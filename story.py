In a village far far away there lived a frail little boy named Juan. Now lets pretend
that you are Juan.

While frail and weak as you are, you have a very strong sense of justice and love for
your family and village.

One day a Dragon named Katol came and terrorized the village. Katol killed many villagers.
Once he was satisfied with the killings, he went and talked to the village elder.
He told the village elder that he is now taking over the village and that the villagers will
now work to gather gold in a not so far mountain.

Some weeks went by and the villagers attempted to usurp Katol's reign but to no avail. This
only angered the dragon and he killed more villagers. And so, filled with despair and
helplessness, the villagers went on and complied with the dragon's reign.
